# Everything you need to know about Google ML Bootcamp

# So what is Google ML Bootcamp?

Google ML Bootcamp is a learning program offered by Google (obviously) to promote Machine Learning among students/professionals and equip them with the right tools and skills needed to make a career.

The entire program is divided into different phases. Each phase has a specific goal and a deadline. After the successful completion of each phase, you move on to the next, and so on till you graduate. Let's talk about these phases in detail below (sometimes phases run parallel to each other but you should be able to manage):

1. **Deep Learning Specialization:** You will get to complete the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) created by Andrew Ng and offered by Deeplearning.ai. Google will fund the cost associated with this course.
    
2. **Kaggle Challenges:** You will get a chance to showcase what you've learned so far by participating in these Kaggle competitions. You also get the opportunity to interact and form teams with your fellow participants to enter these challenges.
    
3. **Expert sessions, Company one-on-ones, etc.:** Experts from different companies hop on a meet every other week and talk/teach about different complex topics. Company one-on-ones are a chance for different companies to showcase how they are using AI to build their products of the future. At the end of the program, graduates can apply to these companies for internships or full-time roles.
    
4. **Certification:** Candidates who reach this phase get to choose one certification from the following:
    
    a. **TensorFlow certification**
    
    b. **GCP Professional Data Engineer Certification**
    
    c. **GCP Professional ML Engineer Certification**
    
    After choosing your certification, you must start preparing for it. There are a lot of certification-specific facilitation sessions that you can attend to learn more.
    
    And the best part? Google sponsors you to appear for the exam for whichever certification you choose (one attempt only). Once you're ready...go for it.
    
    I selected the TensorFlow certification and successfully completed it. Here's it is if you want to take a look:

Woopie! You worked hard for 4 months and now you've graduated. Take a look back and see what you've gained!

Some additional questions: **Time commitment:** Whatever works for you as long as you stick to the deadlines. **Duration:** Approx. 4 months.

# That's awesome! So how do I apply?

The application form can be found on the official website of the program: [https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-ml-bootcamp-india](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-ml-bootcamp-india)

Keep an eye out for the next cohort and fill up the form when it's open.

## Can I apply?

Anybody who hasn't completed the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization, TensorFlow certification, GCP Professional Data Engineer Certification, and GCP Professional ML Engineer Certification can apply.

It doesn't matter if you are a student, an ML professional, a non-ML professional, or someone else. All that matters is that you're as excited about Machine Learning as everybody else.

## I applied. What next?

The next step is to go through the screening (criteria: unknown). Shortlisted candidates are invited to take a quiz and then it's only a matter of time before that "Congratulations!" email pops up in your inbox.

## Cool. Tell me more about the Quiz.

I won't be able to share the quiz questions but I can give you a brief overview of what to expect. Before that, take a look at some of the screenshots of my quiz below:

The questions in the quiz will test your knowledge of **Python**. So, to prepare I would recommend you brush up on the following topics:

1. **Computer science fundamentals** (like operating systems, data structures & algorithms, and computer architecture)
    
2. **Data types**
    
3. **Loops**
    
4. **Pure python-y stuff** (like slicing, single line *for* loops, etc.)
    
5. **Object Oriented Programming** in Python (**very important**)
    

# Wait. What do I get in return?

1. An experience of a lifetime
    
2. A chance to interact and create a network of **more than 200** like-minded ML enthusiasts
    
3. Also, the **certification** of your choice (all of which are **highly recognized** in the industry)
    
4. **Swags** after the successful completion of **every phase**. Here are mine:

I had a wonderful experience in the second cohort of GMLB 2022. The community manager was very supportive and solved all our queries. I also met some really awesome people who are doing great in ML and I learned a lot from their experiences. I would definitely recommend everyone who's come this far, to apply for it and experience everything I have written here for themselves.

If you have any questions or feel that I have missed out on some points, please feel free to drop a comment. I will be happy to include that information here.

**Thanks for reading** and **all the best** if you have or are planning to apply to the next cohort!
