# First article on Hashnode

Woohoo! This is my first blog post on Hashnode.

I plan to use this blog to document my thoughts and understanding of specific technical topics as I go deeper and deeper into AI and research. It will help me to push myself and explore/research topics I don’t fully understand.

This blog will also help me \[and hopefully the readers (if any!)\] to learn from my mistakes and experiences.

Okay bye ✌
